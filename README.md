# README

This project is a simple rails blog. It has a user authentication feature which allows said user to access the ability to do the following:
  * Create a new article with title and text components
  * Edit articles the user created
  * Add comments to any article
  * Destroy articles the user created
  
  I created this project simply to practice and further get to know Ruby on Rails.
